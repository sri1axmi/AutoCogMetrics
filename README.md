# ðŸ§  AutoCogMetrics â€” Automated Cognitive Metrics Classification Framework

AutoCogMetrics is an **advanced humanâ€“machine collaboration tool** that uses computational models to analyze and interpret **human cognitive metrics** such as attention, stress levels, workload, and decision-making capabilities.  

The framework helps in **real-time cognitive state assessment**, enabling adaptive systems that can respond intelligently to human conditions and improve task efficiency, safety, and performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Sensor-based cognitive metrics (e.g., EEG, HRV, task performance)
   - Preprocessed datasets with labeled cognitive states
2. **Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and normalization using Pandas & NumPy
   - Feature extraction for both statistical and deep learning models
3. **Model Training**
   - **SVM** for classical machine learning classification
   - **CNN** for time-series and image-like cognitive data
4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics
   - Cross-validation for robust model selection
5. **Visualization**
   - Heatmaps for correlation between metrics
   - Line plots showing trends in cognitive state changes

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| SVM   | 0.89     | 0.88      | 0.87   | 0.87     |
| CNN   | 0.93     | 0.92      | 0.91   | 0.92     |

âœ… **CNN outperforms SVM** in capturing complex patterns, while SVM offers computational efficiency for smaller datasets.
